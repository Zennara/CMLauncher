# Contributing Guidelines for CMLauncher

Thank you for contributing to CMLauncher, our CastleMinerZ Game launcher! Your contributions help improve the project. Please follow these guidelines:

---

## 1. Fork and Clone

- **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking the CMLauncher repository.
- **Clone Your Fork:** Clone your fork locally to begin working on your changes.

---

## 2. Branching and Stability

- **Create a Feature Branch:** Always create your feature or fix branch from the `dev` branch. Use a descriptive name that reflects the change or issue being addressed.
- **Maintain Stability:** The `dev` branch should always be kept in a stable state. Before merging your changes, ensure that your code is fully tested and does not break existing functionality.
- **Work Locally:** Make your changes in your new branch and commit often with clear, descriptive messages.

---

## 3. Issues and Pull Requests

- **Reference Issues:** If your change fixes an issue (or multiple), please open the issue if it doesnâ€™t exist yet, or use the existing one. When submitting a pull request (PR), reference the issue(s) by tagging them (e.g., `#123`).
- **Submit PRs from `dev`:** All PRs should originate from your `dev` branch. When ready, submit your pull request to the `dev` branch of the main repository.

---

## 4. Deployment Branch

- **Main Branch:** The `main` branch is strictly for deployment. It should only be updated via pull requests that come from the `main` branch.  
  **Note:** Do not submit feature or fix PRs directly to `main`.

---

## 5. Review Process

- **Code Review:** Once your PR is submitted, it will be reviewed. Please address any feedback or requested changes.
- **Testing:** Ensure that your changes are well-tested and maintain the stability of the `dev` branch.

---

## 6. Additional Recommendations

- **Documentation:** Update or add documentation where necessary. Clear documentation helps other contributors understand and maintain the code.
- **Code Style:** Follow the existing code style guidelines. Consistency in code style helps maintain code quality. If using a linter or formatter, ensure your code adheres to its rules.
- **Commit Messages:** Write clear, concise commit messages that explain what and why changes were made.
- **Communication:** When submitting PRs or discussing changes, be clear and respectful in your communication.
- **Pull Request Template:** If available, use the provided PR template to structure your submission. This helps reviewers understand the changes and context quickly.
